# üè¢ Part 4: SaaS Multi-Tenant Design + Data Privacy
# ‚úÖ Overview
In a SaaS (Software as a Service) model, a multi-tenant architecture allows a single application instance to serve multiple clients (tenants), with each client‚Äôs data logically isolated. For CRM/CLM systems that include voice interaction logs, maintaining data segregation, user role management, and secure logging becomes essential to ensure privacy, scalability, and compliance.
This project focuses on designing a secure, scalable data schema tailored for multi-client CRM systems with voice logs.
# üéØ Objective
* To propose a relational data schema that supports multi-tenancy for a SaaS-based CRM/CLM solution.
* To ensure logical data separation between tenants while enabling role-based access control at the user level.
* To integrate voice log handling with appropriate metadata, ensuring privacy and traceability.
* To highlight how data isolation and log security mechanisms prevent unauthorized access and support compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
# üìä Key Components
* Tenants Table: Contains metadata for each organization using the CRM system.
* Users Table: Stores user details linked to their respective tenant with roles (admin, sales rep, etc.).
* Leads Table: Captures lead information scoped to a specific tenant.
* Voice Logs Table: Stores log entries with links to users, leads, and timestamps, possibly referencing secure storage (e.g., S3 URL).
* Each table is designed with a tenant_id to enforce isolation at the query and application layer.
# üßæ Conclusion
* The proposed multi-tenant schema offers a robust and secure foundation for delivering a CRM/CLM platform that scales across organizations while ensuring data privacy and separation. The design enables:
* Clear boundaries between client data (via tenant_id)
* Secure storage and access control for sensitive voice logs
* Compliance with privacy standards and regulatory requirements
